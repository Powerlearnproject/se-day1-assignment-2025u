Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Softwares Crisis and the Birth of Software engineering (Late 1960)
Prior to this period, software development was often  ad- hoc.as softwares systems grew in complexity, projects frequently suffered from the delays, cost overuns and unrealiable outputs.Tjis period became known as the software crisis. ln 1968 and 1969 NNATO Science commitee conference was held and it played a crucial  role in establishing software engineering as a distinct didcipline.This milestone marked the recognition that software development required a structured, engineering based approach, emphasizing principles like design and quality control.
The Rise of object- Oriented programming(OOP)(1980s-1990s),
Object oriented programming revolutionized software design by introducing the concept modular, reusable and maintenance code. Languages like C++ and Java popularized OOP, enabling developers to create more modular and maintenance code.OOP facilitated the development of complex software  of complex softwares systems by  promoting  concepts like inheritance, polymorhism and encapsulation which improved code organization and recuced complexity.
The internet Age and Agile methodologies ( Late 1990s-2000s)
The widespread adoption of the internet and the world wide web transformed softwares development , leading to the creation  of web application and distributed systems.This era also saw the rise of agile methodologies, such as scrums and kanban, which emphasize the iterative  development and collaboration. Agile methodologies addressed the needs for faster development cycles and greater flexibility in response to rapid evolving requirements. The rise of cloud computing and mobile  computing   heavily impacted software engineering during this time, and extending  into the present.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning:This the initial phase focusses on defining the prohect scope, hoals and objectives, it involves gathering requirements, conducting feasibility studies and creating  project plan.key activities include, defining project goals, estimating resources and scheduling timelines 
Requirements Analysis:This phase involves gathering qnd documenting the specific requirements of the software, it focuses on understanding the needs of users and stakeholders.The outcome is a detailed requirements soecification documents.
Design: This phase ,the software architecture and design are  created.it involves translating the requirements into detailed blueprint of the systems.The activities include designing the user interface, database, and overal system architecture.
Implementation (coding ) .This is where is where the  actual coding of the software takes place.Developers write the code based on designing specifications it also involves selecting  appreciate programming languages and tools.
Testing: This phase, focuses  on identifying and fixing defects and errors in the software. Various techniques are used here, by including unit testing, integration testing and system testing .
Deployment: This phase involves releasing the software to end users. it includes installing qnd configuring bthe software in the  production environment.Deployment strategies may vary depending on the type of software.
Maintenance:The ongoing phases involves providing support and update to software after it has been deployed.The goal is to ensure that software remains functional and up to date .


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology.
Key characteristic

Emphasize on thorough upfront planning and documentation.
Linear and Sequential progression 
Resistance to changes once a phase is complete.
Appropriate Scenarios:
Large- Scale construction projects:
Building  abridge or building requires precise planning and adderance to a strict sequence
Government projects with strict regulation:Developing systems for handling sensitive data or  complying with legal requirements often  necessities a rigid, documented process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models

Prompt Engineering, is the practice of designing and refining  input prompts to elicit desired outputs from artificial intelligence (AI)models, particularly large language models (LLMs)
Importance of Prompt Engineering.
Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance: A well crafted prompt enable Al models to better understand the user intent , leading to more accurate and relevant outputs
Improved control and Prefictability: 
it provide greator control over the Al modeld behavior , allowing users to influence the style , tone. This is crucial for application where specific outputs  formats or contents guidance are required.
Increaded  Efficiency and Productivity's: prompt can reduce the need to iterative interaction with the Ai models saving om time and effort .

Mitigation of Bias and Harmful outputs: It help in mitigating biaseses present in thr training data of Al models 
Unlcocking advanced capabilities 
it unclock adbanced capabilities of AL mode's such as complex reasoning.
Improved user Experience: prompt  prodiced  reliable and useful outputs , prompt engineering improved the overall user experience of interacting with Al models .



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Why its vague:
Lack of specificty , something is incredibly broad eg poem 
Improved prompt: Write a concise paragraph describing the hunting behavior of domedtic  cats 

Why improved prompt is more effective.
Clarity: it explicit states the desired output a paragraph 
Specificity:it defines the topic, hunting behavior of domestic cats 
Context: it specifices the focus,stealth and pounce techniques
Actionable: it uses a clear verb.
